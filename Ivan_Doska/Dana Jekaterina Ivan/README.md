TamaLab is a console-based virtual pet simulation written in Python.
The project demonstrates object-oriented programming, structured game architecture, and numerical state management using NumPy.
The pet’s condition is represented as a numerical state vector that evolves over time based on player actions and internal game rules.
The system is modular and extensible, allowing new mechanics such as items, events, achievements, and mini-games to be added without modifying the core logic.
TamaLab focuses on clean code structure, separation of responsibilities, and practical use of Python data structures and libraries.
